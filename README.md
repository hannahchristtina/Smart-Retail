# SmartRetail: Sales Forecasting and Customer Analytics with Machine Learning
This project demonstrates how machine learning can enhance retail operations by accurately forecasting sales and analyzing customer behavior to support smarter, data-driven business decisions.

# Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Prophet): Core frameworks for data preprocessing, modeling, and analysis.
- ARIMA & Prophet: Time-series forecasting models for predicting sales trends.
- Random Forest Regression: Predicts sales using product and customer attributes.
- K-Means Clustering: Segments customers based on RFM analysis.
- Jupyter Notebook & VS Code: Used for development and experimentation.

# Project Goal
The projectâ€™s main objective is to empower retailers with predictive and analytical tools to optimize operations and customer engagement. This is achieved by:
- Sales Forecasting: Using ARIMA, Prophet, and Random Forest to predict future demand.
- Customer Segmentation: Applying RFM analysis with K-Means clustering for targeted marketing.
- Data-Driven Decisions: Delivering actionable insights to improve planning, inventory, and profitability.
